A mathematical object analogous to but more general than a vector, represented by an array of components that are functions of the coordinates of a space.

Tensors provide a natural and concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving problems in areas of physics such as elasticity, fluid mechanics, and general relativity.

The notation for a tensor is similar to that of a matrix (i.e., A=(a_(ij))), except that a tensor a_(ijk...), a^(ijk...), a_i^(jk)..., etc., may have an arbitrary number of indices. In addition, a tensor with rank r+s may be of mixed type (r,s), consisting of r so-called "contravariant" (upper) indices and s "covariant" (lower) indices. Note that the positions of the slots in which contravariant and covariant indices are placed are significant so, for example,  a_(munu)^lambda is distinct from a_mu^(nulambda).

While the distinction between covariant and contravariant indices must be made for general tensors, the two are equivalent for tensors in three-dimensional Euclidean space, and such tensors are known as Cartesian tensors.

Objects that transform like zeroth-rank tensors are called scalars, those that transform like first-rank tensors are called vectors, and those that transform like second-rank tensors are called matrices. In tensor notation, a vector v would be written v_i, where i=1, ..., m, and matrix is a tensor of type (1,1), which would be written a_i^j in tensor notation.
